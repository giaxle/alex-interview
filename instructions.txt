Instructions

For this project, you will create an image gallery. 

Do this in pure javascript!

You should be able to upload images and display them in a thumbnail list. When an image thumbnail is selected, a larger version of that image should be displayed. The user should also be able to delete images from the gallery. For each image, create a "like" button that increments everytime it is selected and display the number. An example of this is something like instagram.

Requirements:
  1. The user should be able to upload either an image folder or an images one by one
  2. Each image should have its own thumbnail displayed in a list
  3. When an image thumbnail is selected, a larger copy of that image should be displayed
  4. Enable the user to delete the image from the gallery
  5. Create a "like" button that increments everytime it is selected. Display the number of likes and the number should remain consistent when switching between images.

Styling this gallery is up to you, just make it intuitive.
An example of how the end result could look is included in the file called 'example.png'
